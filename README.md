# Task 1

1. Print possible variants of keys for 8-,16-,32-,64-,128-, 256-, 512- , 1024-, 2048-, 4096- bits sequence

Number of keys equals 2^n, where n - bits (8,16,32 etc)

2. Generate random key in range of 0x00..0 - 0xFF..F (len for 8,16,32 etc bit sequence)

It's not a problem to generate 8-,16,32,64 etc 4096 len key, but starting from 64 bit it's time consuming to brute force it

3. Using brute force method try to find random generated key in key sequence 

Code shows brute force method for 8, 16, 32 bits key
Time to brute force 8,16 key is seconds, 32 bits took about (Apple M1 Pro chip with 16 RAM)
